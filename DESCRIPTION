Description: The diverstidy package provides several functions that help detect patterns in 
                unstandardized text data for analyses of geographies, populations, other forms 
                of diversity. Currently, there is one function for detecting geographies and 17 additional 
                functions that detect terms across the following subdomains of diversity-related research: 
                ancestry, culture, disability, discrimination, diversity, equity, inclusion, linguistic, 
                migration, population, race/ethnicity, religious, sex/gender, sexuality, social class, 
                and US OMB population terms. Although somewhat simple, the intuition behind these functions 
                is to detect the quantity of diversity-related terms show up in a given text entry. 
                There are a number of case studies, but the primary uses of these functions are to examine 
                historical trends in term usage and/or to detect potential biases in text.
